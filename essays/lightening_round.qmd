- If Ashkan doesnâ€™t earn an A, then nobody should, because I know he spends hours and hours every week on completing the coursework to the best of his ability.
- I think the most difficult part of the class for me was the amount of work given to us to learn outside of class. The time commitment can be a lot for a student with a full plate.
- I liked the labs and challenges as we had the opportunity to return these labs in, so it made it far less stressful. 
- The grading model definitely surprised me the most, I have never taken a class with such a unique approach, but overall I enjoyed it as it put the student first.
- Although a cliche, I would say just start your assignments early, and do them as soon as possible. Also watch out for the peer reviews!
